# Extinctions.jl

A Julia project for extinction simulations in interaction networks.

The idea is to develop functionality for simulating extinctions in species interaction networks that plays and integrates with [`SpeciesInteractionNetworks.jl`](https://poisotlab.github.io/SpeciesInteractionNetworks.jl/dev/) and (at minimum) has similar extinction pathways/mechnisms as those from the `R` package [`cheddar`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cheddar/cheddar.pdf)
